# bowtie â‹ˆ #
A program to perform analysis on Time Interval Error (TIE)

This program was build to perform [MTIE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_time_interval_error) and [TDEV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_deviation) analysis on TIE values. The program was tested with data recorded with the omniber 718 and the sj300e. Other devices should be compatible if they use plain column based text files.

Further information and copyright can be found in bowtie.cabal

## Program input ##
The program takes plain text files (or stdin) with data in columns. Columns can only be separated with spaces. A value column holds the sampled data. An optional time column can be given, otherwise a sampletime must be specified. Example of input data with first column showing time (in seconds) and second column sampled values (in nanoseconds):

```
0.000 0.700
0.020 0.000
0.040 -0.700
0.060 0.000
```

Giving the flag `--device` or `-d` with argument `sj300e_binary` reads in a special format of 
Tektronix SJ300E SONET/SDH Jitter and Wander Analyzer accompanied software called "Wander Analyst" when exported in binary format. Setting any other devices including `sj300e` takes the plain text format. Setting any other devices presets the values for sampletime and column selection. The device flag works well in the way i personally use this program, for general use i recommend you don't use it and give the sample time `-s` and value column `-v`. I don't recommend using the time column either since it uses more space to store your files and the program is slower as well since it can not assume equally spaced samples.

For further information on flags and input options, run bowtie with `--help` or consult the source code.

## Running bowtie ##
Make sure your terminal supports utf8. You can find your OS supported utf8 variants with `locale -a | grep utf`. Use this value for your `LC_*` environment variables. I'm not sure which `LC_*` variable should be set, but in any case setting `LC_ALL` should override them all and thus always works. If you don't want to set your environment to utf8 permanently you can start the program with `LC_ALL=en_US.utf8 ./bowtie --help`. Here the value `en_US.utf8` was used, but it could be as well `en_US.utf-8` (with a dash between `utf` and `8`) or anything similar to that (again please check `locale -a | grep utf`).

## Measurement devices ##
These devices can be used to measure TIE values on SDH/SONET lines. There are a lot of other devices on the market that can perform these measurements as well. As the program input is just plain text format it should be really easy to make bowtie compatible with any device.

## Build/run/debug commands ##

### Without llvm ###
`stack build --executable-stripping --ghc-options="-j4 -O2 -fexcess-precision -optc-O3 -optc-ffast-math -rtsopts=none -no-rtsopts-suggestions -split-objs -split-sections"`

### With llvm 3.7 ###
`stack build --executable-stripping --ghc-options="-j4 -O2 -fexcess-precision -optc-O3 -optc-ffast-math -rtsopts=none -no-rtsopts-suggestions -split-objs -split-sections -fllvm"`

### With llvm 3.7 into release folder ###
Use this build command to make the release binary.

`stack install --local-bin-path release --executable-stripping --ghc-options="-j4 -O2 -fexcess-precision -optc-O3 -optc-ffast-math -rtsopts=none -no-rtsopts-suggestions -split-objs -split-sections -fllvm"`

### With llvm 3.7 and threading ###
Do not use this build command. There is no parallelism in the program and it makes the program actually slower.

`stack build --executable-stripping --ghc-options="-j4 -O2 -fexcess-precision -optc-O3 -optc-ffast-math -threaded -rtsopts=none -with-rtsopts=-N -no-rtsopts-suggestions -split-objs -split-sections -fllvm"`

### Build for strace (to see system calls) ###
`stack build --executable-stripping --ghc-options="-j4 -O2 -fexcess-precision -optc-O3 -optc-ffast-math -rtsopts -no-rtsopts-suggestions -split-objs -split-sections -fllvm"`

Run with `stack exec -- strace -e 'trace=!getrusage,rt_sigprocmask' bowtie args +RTS -V0`

### Build for profiling ###
`stack build --profile --fast --ghc-options="-j -auto-all +RTS -A128m -n2m -RTS"`

Run with profiling: `stack exec -- bowtie +RTS -p`

Run with profiling for exceptions: `stack exec -- bowtie +RTS -xc`

### Verifying program stdout/stderr ###
`bowtie > >(sed 's/^/stdout:/') 2> >(sed 's/^/stderr:/' >&2); sleep 1`

### (GHCI) run commands for testing ###
```
  :set -fbreak-on-exception
  :set -fbreak-on-error
  :set args -c mtie -i sample_sj300e_bin.dat -d sj300e_binary
  :set args -c mtie -i processed_samples_time.dat -t 1 -v 2
  :trace main

  :main -c mtie -i sample_sj300e_bin_short.dat -d sj300e_binary
```

Measure time: `/usr/bin/time stack exec -- bowtie -c mtie -i sample_sj300e_bin.dat -d sj300e_binary`

## Todo's ##
* Instead of using `evalStateC` in `adjustSampleInterval` use `runStateC` so that a summary of the input data can be shown.
* Create a command line flag to limit the upper bound of the calculated samples. This is now always the maximum see `n_max` in `tdevs9` (but also applies for mtie). This is useful for two reasons 1. the standards often require that more samples are needed to give a data point reliable, that means for the samples at the upper bound need to be trimmed 2. saves some calculations.
* Remove the skipValues option. The data should already be clean when feeding into bowtie.
* Add [exit codes](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.10.0.0/docs/System-Exit.html) `[exitFoo, exitBar] = map (exitWith . exitFailure) [2..]` or `(foo, bar, _) map bla [1..]`
* Show the program version without having to specify the `-c` flag (this is just silly right now).
* Investigate to use logarithmic for mtie just as for tdev.

## Nice to have's ##
* Criterion benchmarking for different algorithm implementations [criterion tutorial](http://www.serpentine.com/criterion/tutorial.html)
* Any further speed optimization, [flamegraphs](https://www.fpcomplete.com/blog/2015/04/ghc-prof-flamegraph) are useful.
* Try to boost performance with unpacking values. [1](https://downloads.haskell.org/~ghc/latest/docs/html/users_guide/glasgow_exts.html#unpack-pragma) [2](http://johantibell.com/files/haskell-performance-patterns.html)
* Look into exporting information about the data (possible to a file), this could be used to assist gnuplot.
* Look into refactoring accConduit and tdev into a single function somehow, they belong together but are not spread out in the code.
* Test if parallelism helps with calculating the mtie (on a simple test it didn't help with tdev). Possibly use [stm-conduit](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/stm-conduit)
* Optimize the parsing function (this showed to be a bit slow during profiling) [Efficient parsing guide](http://hbtvl.banquise.net/series/Efficient%20parsing.html)
* Remove resampling function from the program. The data should already be clean when feeding into bowtie. If it's still needed this could be broken out in a separate program and use linux pipes (bowtie supports stdin/stdout for data).
* Possibly make another program that can add timestamps to single-column data or turn two-column (time, value) into value only. Likely it's a good idea to put this with the resampling program (see point above).
* Recalculate samples given a `t`. Useful when two-column input doesn't start at `t=0` or if a part of the recording needs to be skipped. All samples need to be corrected for the offset at the given time.
* Proof that all the safety checks in the mtie algorithm are actually needed or if they can be removed for more performance.
* Look into further algorithm improvements for mtie (look in Algos.hs for recommendations)
